### Test Objective
Verify that the **[Unit Name]** correctly handles [Scenario, e.g., Integer Overflow] as defined in **SWD-XXX**.

### Test Strategy (ISO 26262)
* **Method:** [e.g., Boundary Value Analysis]
* **Inputs Tested:** [e.g., 0, 1, MaxInt, MaxInt+1]
* **Fault Injection:** [e.g., Simulated sensor disconnect]

### Evidence Description
This evidence item validates the requirement by analyzing the automated test report located at `artifacts/verification/...`.
